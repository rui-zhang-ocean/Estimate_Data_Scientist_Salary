    "The purpose is to build a web application using the model trained in previous step. A user could input data on company details, job features and skills and get a return of estimated salary.The web app is built with Streamlit and deployed with Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application can be accessed [here](https://estimate-data-scientist-salary.herokuapp.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "General steps:\n",
    " - create `web_app.py` which builds the web application interface with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)\n",
    " - create `requirements.txt` using `pipreqs`\n",
    " - create `setup.sh` which contains configuration for the server\n",
    " - create `Procfile` which executives the app\n",
    " - sign up with [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/), log in and create a new app, this could either be done via browser or terminal, the app name is randomly generated first, and could be modified later under the `Settings` tag on Heroku website.\n",
    " - Heroku provided version control with `Heroku CLI`, I chose to use `Github`. Under the `Deploy` tag, you can easily specify connection with `Github` and deploy specified branch manually.\n",
