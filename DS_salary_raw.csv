We value a positive attitude and the ability to adapt, learn, and collaborate.
We embrace the individuality of our employees and we celebrate each other's differences. Our work benefits from and thrives on the unique perspectives brought by each person on our team.

Job Summary
JOB OVERVIEW
As clinical and medical data is increasingly digitized, there is increasing opportunity to analyze this data for research purposes in a variety of ways that leverage “big data” characteristics of digital medical data.

Our clinical research effort employs novel analytic techniques, which include machine learning techniques, to identify complex patterns medical data derived from various sources - both collected through routine clinical care and expressly collected for research purposes. Related to this goal, the Bioinformatics Programmer/Data Scientist will assist in managing, cleaning and analyzing large scale medical data using a wide variety of analytic techniques. The Data Scientist will be involved in developing software pipelines, mostly using Python, for data extraction which will need to be developed de novo to obtain data from various clinical systems or sources. Once the data is obtained, pipelines will be created to clean the data and store the data in file-systems appropriate for the size of the data at hand. Experience with databases or the ability to learn will be requisite. Under the supervision of the PI, the Data Scientist will also be involved in data analysis, and will be fluent in comparing a variety of techniques, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, to be able to empirically determine which approach is most suitable for the given research hypothesis and data type. The ability to learn and implement new techniques depending on the problem at hand will be an essential skill, thus requiring a strong foundation in Python and competency to bootstrap novel algorithmic implementations as needs arise. This position may also include some administrative duties and will have the opportunity to participate in and lead authorship teams.

You are comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

About the Role:

The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:
Clinical - Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions? This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members? Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members? This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care? Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.

We value a positive attitude and the ability to adapt, learn, and collaborate.
We embrace the individuality of our employees and we celebrate each other's differences. Our work benefits from and thrives on the unique perspectives brought by each person on our team.
